        Despite only doing a vague imitation of walking I'm climbing Snowden. Let the SchadenFreude commence (also you can [Snowdon Blog]("http://www.charitygiving.co.uk/snowdon_attempt"))

                3.5 miles takes me 4 hours, and that's my maximum before my legs start giving out. Those 5 miles take normal walkers 3.5 hours

                That means you're walking at a third of the speed of a normal walker, so this is going to take you 10.5 hours?

I don't really like talking about disability. Its pretty much like commutting, you have to deal with it, its tedious (understatement) and just best muddled through and dealt with with as little fuss as humanly possible.

However today for a month only I'm breaking that rule as I\'m climbing Snowdon next month and feel like I can at last use it to wangle hard earned cash out of my friends and colleagues.

This is the first year that I'm not spending most of my time in a wheelchair in the last 8 years and to celebrate I'm climbing Snowdon, the highest mountain in the UK

On every scale, I can't actually do this. I've been training twice a week since Christmas and haven't managed to do more than 3.5 miles on the flat. If I leave early enough, hopefully I'll be able to take lots of rests. Hopefully it doesn't rain (or snow). I'm sure it'll be fine...

All this is in aid of the [Islington Community Theatre](Islington Community Theatre) a fantastic company that make a big difference. They also have [upcoming shows](http://www.islingtoncommunitytheatre.com/centre/)
